# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS :

           This Java application demonstrates a real-time chat application built using Java Sockets and Multithreading. It allows multiple clients to connect to a server and communicate in real time. Each client can send messages to the server, which broadcasts these messages to all other connected clients. This is a basic example of a client-server architecture with the server acting as a central hub, handling communication between clients.

Libraries and Classes Used:
The main library used in this program is java.net, which provides the necessary tools for network communication (sockets) in Java. Additionally, multithreading is used to allow multiple clients to interact with the server simultaneously.

java.net.ServerSocket: This class is used to create a server socket that listens for incoming client connections. The server socket waits for requests from clients and accepts the connections when they arrive.

java.net.Socket: This class represents the socket that is used by both the server and clients to communicate. A server creates a ServerSocket to listen for client connections, and once connected, both sides use Socket objects to send and receive data.

java.io.BufferedReader: This is used to read data (messages) sent by the clients and the server. It reads text from an input stream (such as the socket input stream) efficiently, line by line.

java.io.PrintWriter: This is used to write data to the output stream. It allows the server to send messages back to clients, and clients to send messages to the server.
